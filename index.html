            <p>
                The game uses a 2D grid (`worldMap`) to represent the environment. The player's position and orientation are used to cast rays and render walls in pseudo-3D. Collision detection ensures the player cannot move through walls.

            <p>
                Starting this raycasting project offers an excellent opportunity to dive into game development fundamentals while creating an interactive 3D-like environment from scratch. By building this SDL2-based maze game, you'll gain hands-on experience with core computer graphics concepts like raycasting algorithms, collision detection, and real-time rendering - the same techniques used in classic games like Wolfenstein 3D. The project helps strengthen your C programming skills while introducing important game development concepts such as player movement, world representation, and pseudo-3D perspective rendering. It's a perfect balance of challenge and reward, giving you a functional, visually interesting game while keeping the scope manageable for a single developer. Whether you're looking to build your portfolio, understand low-level graphics programming, or just create something fun, this project provides a satisfying way to level up your coding skills while producing a playable result you can showcase and expand upon.
